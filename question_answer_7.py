# Define a function with 'arbitrary numbers of arguments' method named as ‘spec_opr
# (*numbers)’ . This function sums all of the arguments after a process. This process 
# is even numbers should be divided by 2 and odd numbers should be multiplied with 3 
# first and then added to the total sum.
# Examples:
# spec_opr(3, 2, 6) should return 13,
# spec_opr(58, 53, 10, -10, -40, -28, 8, 34, 70, -16, 33) should return 301,
# spec_opr(93, 12, 5, 84, -22) should return 331
